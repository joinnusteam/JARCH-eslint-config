# Contributing guidelines

## Requirements for development

- Node.js 18/20
- npm 9/10

## Initialize development environment

Use [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating) to prepare environment.

There is a [`.nvmrc`](../.nvmrc), so you just need to run in the root directory:

```sh
nvm install
nvm use
# Now using node v20.8.0 (npm v10.1.0)
```

> You can setup [shell integration for nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#deeper-shell-integration) to do this automatically when moving to directory.

Install dependencies, and start to make

```
npm install
```
